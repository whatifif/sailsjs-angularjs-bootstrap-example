# This is ejs version of original

I made this because Sails's default template engine is 'ejs' not 'jade'. And for me, 'ejs' is easier to learn and understand than 'jade'.

# sailsjs-angularjs-bootstrap-example #

> A suite of examples written for Sails.js, AngularJS, and Twitter Bootstrap.

Contents:

- A REST API test page using Sails' transport agnostic routing (HTTP vs. Socket.io)
- A "Todo List" app demo using Sails' Socket.io messaging and REST Blueprints
- Passport middleware authentication integrated with Sails policies.
- Twitter Bootstrap / Font Awesome custom LESS compiles (Grunt)
- Cache busting JS/CSS for production (Grunt)

## Notes ##
*(as of May 5, 2014)*

Updated to latest Sails.js version `0.9.16` and added some fixes for
[error handling](https://github.com/cgmartin/sailsjs-angularjs-bootstrap-example/issues/15).

The `config/500.js` file has changed to include a 4th parameter to notify express'
middleware that it is an error handler. Several jade files have also been edited to remove the `!!!` deprecated doctype.
This fixes the html views for 404 and 500 error pages, as well as the oddity I had seen in January with 500 errors on
the API test page. The 403 forbidden errors are still inconsistent between HTTP and Socket modes (???).

*(as of Jan 7, 2014)*

Be wary, this repo has been quickly hacked together as a Sails.js/AngularJS
learning project. Do not consider it as production-ready code.

**REST API example page** (see `assets/linker/js/controllers/restCtrl.js`)

This API test page was primarily made to exercise the error handling of REST
calls between HTTP and Socket modes (404, 403, 500 errors). I am currently
seeing some odd behavior when throwing 500 application errors, and when 403
forbidden errors are triggered from policy configurations. The results are not
consistent between modes. More research is needed.

**Todo List app demo** (see `assets/linker/js/controllers/todoCtrl.js`)

This demo was written to explore how the socket.io connection, comet messages,
and auto-subscriptions work in Sails. The
[AngularJS TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/architecture-examples/angularjs-perf/#/)
examples were used a bit for reference. The Sails socket.io code, which is
provided during creation of a new Sails project, was refactored into an Angular
service (see `assets/linker/js/angular-sails.io.js`). It contains custom retry
logic that first sends a `$http.get()` request to the server for obtaining the
security token cookie, otherwise you may encounter the
`500 error: "handshake error"` when restarting your local server
(See bottom of: [FAQ](http://sailsjs.org/#!documentation/sockets)).

If you stop the server or cause a network disconnect when on the example pages,
you should see some alert modals pop up. These are managed by SailsSocketCtrl
(see `assets/linker/js/controllers/sailsSocketCtrl.js`) for reuse across examples.

**Passport Integration**

Credit goes to [this gist](https://gist.github.com/theangryangel/5060446)
and its many forks.

You can log in using the dummy user/pass: `test/test123`.

Here are the files that were touched:
```
api/controllers/PassportAuthController.js
api/models/User.js
api/policies/isPassportAuthenticated.js
config/bootstrap.js
config/express.js
config/policies.js
config/routes.js
views/passportauth/login.jade
views/passportauth/protected.jade
```

**Grunt changes**

The Sails.js asset grunt tasks have been reconfigured to allow Twitter Bootstrap
and Font Awesome custom compiles (see `/assets/linker/styles/*.less`).
The grunt `copy` task has also been reconfigured to include other Bower-managed
client-side libraries.
